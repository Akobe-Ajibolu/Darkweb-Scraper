## Important Note:

- This script is intended for educational purposes only and should not be used for malicious activities.

## Ethical Web Scraping for Security Research

This script demonstrates potential techniques for security researchers to gather information on compromised organizations from publicly available sources on the darkweb (Lockbit). It's crucial to prioritize ethical data collection practices.

Functionality:

- Automate the process of checking for organizations compromised by Lockbit.
- Tor IP Rotation: Includes an optional function to change the researcher's Tor exit node IP address with each script execution, potentially enhancing anonymity.

## Target Audience:

Security professionals who want to learn about potential methods for threat intelligence gathering (within legal and ethical boundaries).

## Future Enhancements:

Explore incorporating data from additional publicly available sources/forums on the dark web.
